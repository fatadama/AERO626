Fitlers developed in python

Folder descriptions:
ekf - Extended Kalman Filter class definition
lib - utility functions used by many classes (mainly resampling for particle filters)
problems - contains implementations of specific problems
sis_particle - sequential importance sampling particle filter. Impractical due to sample impoverishment
ukf - Unscented Kalman Filter class definition

Filters roughly in order of complexity:
- EKF
- UKF
- SIS (will not work well in practical problems)
- SIR
