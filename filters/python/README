Fitlers developed in python

Folder descriptions:
ekf - Extended Kalman Filter class definition
gmm - Gaussian mixture models
lib - utility functions used by many classes (mainly resampling for particle filters)
problems - contains implementations of specific problems
sis_particle - sequential importance sampling particle filter. Impractical due to sample impoverishment
ukf - Unscented Kalman Filter class definition

Filters roughly in order of complexity (least to most):
- EKF
- UKF
- GMM
- SIS (will not work well in practical problems)
- SIR
- ASIR
- EnKF
